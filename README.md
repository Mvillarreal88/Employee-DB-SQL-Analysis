# sql-challenge Employee Database

### Data Modeling:

•	Initially I will use the information that is provided to create a table schema for the 6 CSV files.

•	I will then import each CSV file to the corresponding SQL table.

In the Employee Database we will obtain the following information based on the Data that is provided:

### Data Analysis

1.List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.

2.List first name, last name, and hire date for employees who were hired in 1986.

3.List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager’s employee number, last name, first name.

4.List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

5.List first name, last name, and sex for employees whose first name is “Hercules” and last names begin with “B.”

6.List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

7.List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

8.In descending order, list the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.

###ERD

I then created a relationship model of the tables showing the key values between them, this is uploaded as a PNG file.
